# Implementation-of-Adv-Data-Structures
Projects on advanced algorithms in Graphs like Maximum weighted bipartite matching, Shortest path algorithms like Bellman-Ford algorithm, Djikstra algorithm, DAG, Minimum Spanning Tree algorithms like Kruskal, Prims, Hashing, Priority Queues, ecommerce website like Amazon,  Arithmetic operation on very big numbers using linked list and so on. 
All projects are developed in Java.

FILES IN THE REPOSITORY:

1) All folders and files in the repository are submitted as part of various projects in my course 'Implementation of Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms'.
2) All source code starts with 'mxm135730<fileName>' and please ignore 'mxm135730' as it represents my school ID which is used for evaluation.
3) Each folder contains the 'Question' document asked by my Professor and source codes written in Java.
4) 'mxm135730DriverProgram' in each folder contains the 'main()' function to run the project.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Project10 - (toughest project) Christofides algorithm, Travelling Saleman Problem, Kruskal Algorithm, Minimum weight perfect matching
